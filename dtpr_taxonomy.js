This means making the ideas we’re exploring accessible to everyone, creating a venue for new ideas from the community to emerge, and workshopping ideas together. We believe this open process will help create a much better neighbourhood — a place that is inclusive and can become a beacon for people-centred urban innovation.

To analyze the before and after impacts of the Pilot Program, traffic cameras will be installed to collect traffic video footage at the intersection and street-level. The video footage will be analyzed for key performance indicators around congestion, safety, and curb access. \n\nKenmore Square was selected as the ideal pilot location due to its surrounding land uses and characteristics, including: \n\n\n-Proximity to Boston University. Students (many who are car-free) are a prime demographic for rideshare services.\n\n\n-Proximity to Fenway Park. Major venues must adapt to large crowds arriving and departing within a narrow window of time presenting many pick-up and drop-off constraints. \n\n\n-Proximity to Lansdowne Street’s nightlife. Ridesharing is most popular on nights and weekends in entertainment districts. \n\n\n-Proximity to Kenmore Station. The project area consists of both an MBTA subway stop and bus depot. Rideshare is often used as a first-last mile connection to public transit. \n\n\n-Transferability to other Locations. The on-street, painted bike lane is a common type of bike infrastructure throughout the City. \n\n-Bicyclists experience many instances of the bike lane being blocked by vehicles double parking for pick-up and drop-off loading activity.\n\n\n-Proximity to Kenmore Square. Kenmore Square represents the intersection of two main corridors, Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue, as well as several other cross streets. The intersection is a challenging environment for pedestrians and vehicles to navigate. This presents safety concerns for pick-up and drop-off activity.

To analyze the before and after impacts of the Pilot Program, traffic cameras will be installed to collect traffic video footage at the intersection and street-level. The video footage will be analyzed for key performance indicators around congestion, safety, and curb access. \n\nKenmore Square was selected as the ideal pilot location due to its surrounding land uses and characteristics, including: \n\n\n-Proximity to Boston University. Students (many who are car-free) are a prime demographic for rideshare services.\n\n\n-Proximity to Fenway Park. Major venues must adapt to large crowds arriving and departing within a narrow window of time presenting many pick-up and drop-off constraints. \n\n\n-Proximity to Lansdowne Street’s nightlife. Ridesharing is most popular on nights and weekends in entertainment districts. \n\n\n-Proximity to Kenmore Station. The project area consists of both an MBTA subway stop and bus depot. Rideshare is often used as a first-last mile connection to public transit. \n\n\n-Transferability to other Locations. The on-street, painted bike lane is a common type of bike infrastructure throughout the City. \n\n-Bicyclists experience many instances of the bike lane being blocked by vehicles double parking for pick-up and drop-off loading activity.\n\n\n-Proximity to Kenmore Square. Kenmore Square represents the intersection of two main corridors, Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue, as well as several other cross streets. The intersection is a challenging environment for pedestrians and vehicles to navigate. This presents safety concerns for pick-up and drop-off activity.
